      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">1. Use common sense</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-light">
        This includes being respectful to each other when interacting, as well as not doing (or abusing)
        things that are unintended.
        If you happen to find bugs, please create a ticket in the feedback-support forum on our
        <a href="/discord" class="text-primary">Discord</a>.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">2. Don't cheat.</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-light">
        Seriously, don't. This is meant to be a fun experience for everyone, and this is only given if
        everyone adheres the same rules.
        Therefore, any client modifications, injections, and anything else considered cheating is <strong><u>not</u></strong> allowed.
        You can take the definition of cheating as it exists on the official osu! servers and apply it
        1:1 here.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">3. Don't create multiple accounts</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-light">
        As you are probably used from the official osu! servers, creating more than one account per
        person is a bannable offense.
        If you have a concern suggesting the creation of a new account, please create a ticket in the #
        📞ㆍreport forum on our
        <a href="/discord" class="text-primary">Discord</a>. We will try to help you there as well as we can.
